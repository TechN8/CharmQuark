Rules
-----
Start with a number of pieces such that fewer than n of any one color are touching.
Give player additional pieces periodically.  Period should decrease as score increases.

Remove (n) or more overlapping pieces, add to score.  Should have multiplier for more than (n).

Particle Linking and Traversal
------------------------------
Each particle maintains a list of particles of the same color it is in contact with.
This works, but sometimes does not find largest chain because particles may be slightly separated.  How can I make sure there is a collision?
    . Currently, am not counting pieces which are touching less than 2 other pieces, unless the set already has 4 pieces.
    . Moved scoring to it's own scheduled task.

TODO
----

. Saved Data Plist
    . High score list(s).
    . Music & sound settings.

. High score record.
    . Put on gamecenter.

. Add chain reaction scoring.
    . Increment counter each time scoreParticles runs with score.  This is the combo length.
    . If scoreParticles runs with no score, comboLength = 0
    . Chain scoring acts as second multiplier.
    . Play combo animation.

. Game over menu.  Scenes->GameScene->GameOverLayer
    . Show high score
    . Twitter button

. Main menu with options and website links.
    . Play
    . Options (Sound Volumes).
    . Website link
    . Social media links.
    
. Game modes
    * Survival
    . Time Attack
    . Meditation (This is kind of long, should save game between sessions.)

. Help Screen

. Final Animations
    Exploding particle.  (Try to do a jet with particle effect.)
    Trail effect on dropped particle?
    Score and multiplier animations.
    Thumb guides.  (Do these with sprites).

. Artwork.
    . Prettier sprites.  
        Ideas: 
            . Vector-look with physics symbols.  Magnetic field lines on grid bacground.
            . Astronomical bodies (stars, comets, planets).  Starfield background.
            . Marbles.  Wooden bowl background.
            . Other?
    . Background & Scoreboard
    . Font for score

. Sound effects.
    Grab some samples from http://lhcsound.hep.ucl.ac.uk. 
        These are all CC and generated from LHC data!

. Localization
    Google translate menus.  Game is pretty self explanitory.

. Blur background on overlay layers.
    UIImage *tempImage =[GameScene takeAsUIImage];
    CCTexture2DMutable *mutableTexture = [[[CCTexture2DMutable alloc] tempImage autorelease];
    [AWTextureFilter blur:mutableTexture radius:6];
    
Questionable Enhancements
-------------------------
    
. Automatic drop of extra random pieces?  No auto drop of user pieces?

. Show next 2 pieces?

New Name?
---------
Catseye - Would need artwork to look like glass marbles.
Celestial Spheres - Make the pieces look spacey?  Space themed background.

Monetization
------------
$0.99 initial price.
Enhancement: Unlock additional backgrounds / modes by playing.  Offer in-app purchase to skip score requirements for unlock.
    
Future Enhancement Ideas
------------------------
Left or right handed option.

Special pieces.
    Match anything?
    High KE/mass particle. (Hard hit)
    Exploding particle.  (Shuffle)
    High moment of inertia.
