simToView(x,y)
    x = x * scale + skew
    y = y * scale + skew

Rules
-----
Start with a number of pieces such that fewer than n of any one color are touching.
Give player additional pieces periodically.  Period should decrease as score increases.

Remove (n) or more overlapping pieces, add to score.  Should have multiplier for more than (n).

Particle Linking and Traversal
------------------------------
Each particle maintains a list of particles of the same color it is in contact with.
This works, but sometimes does not find largest chain because particles may be slightly separated.  How can I make sure there is a collision?
    . Currently, am not counting pieces which are touching less than 2 other pieces, unless the set already has 4 pieces.
    . Moved scoring to it's own scheduled task.


New Name?
---------
Catseye - Would need artwork to look like glass marbles.
Celestial Spheres - Make the pieces look spacey?  Space themed background.

$0.99 initial price.
