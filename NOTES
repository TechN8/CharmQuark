Rules
-----
Start with a number of pieces such that fewer than n of any one color are touching.
Give player additional pieces periodically.  Period should decrease as score increases.

Remove (n) or more overlapping pieces, add to score.  Should have multiplier for more than (n).

Particle Linking and Traversal
------------------------------
Each particle maintains a list of particles of the same color it is in contact with.
This works, but sometimes does not find largest chain because particles may be slightly separated.  How can I make sure there is a collision?
    . Currently, am not counting pieces which are touching less than 2 other pieces, unless the set already has 4 pieces.
    . Moved scoring to it's own scheduled task.

TODO
----

X Pause function which suspends all scheduled timers.

. Animation test for particle match.

. Game over overlay.  Scenes->GameScene->GameOverLayer
    Should have final score and buttons for restart, exit, tweet...

. Replace reset button with pause menu. Scenes->GameScene->PauseLayer.
    . Resume
    . Restart
    . Exit

. Main menu with options and website links.
    . Play
    . Options (Sound Volumes).
    . Website link
    . Social media links.


. Blur background on overlay layers.
    UIImage *tempImage =[GameScene takeAsUIImage];
    CCTexture2DMutable *mutableTexture = [[[CCTexture2DMutable alloc] tempImage autorelease];
    [AWTextureFilter blur:mutableTexture radius:6];

. Final Animations
    Exploding particle.  (Try to do a jet with particle effect.)
    Trail effect on dropped particle?
    Score and multiplier animations.
    Thumb guides.  (Do these with sprites).
        . Aiming recticle.
        . Turn radius.

. Artwork.
    . Prettier sprites.  
        Ideas: 
            . Vector-look with physics symbols.  Magnetic field lines on grid bacground.
            . Astronomical bodies (stars, comets, planets).  Starfield background.
            . Marbles.  Wooden bowl background.
            . Other?
    . Background
    . Font for score

. Special pieces.
    Match anything?
    High KE/mass particle. (Hard hit)
    Exploding particle.  (Shuffle)

. Sound effects.
    What should this sound like?  Depends on artwork.
    
Questionable Enhancements
-------------------------
    
. Automatic drop of extra random pieces?  No auto drop of user pieces?

. Show next 2 pieces?

New Name?
---------
Catseye - Would need artwork to look like glass marbles.
Celestial Spheres - Make the pieces look spacey?  Space themed background.

Monetization
------------
$0.99 initial price.
Enhancement: Unlock additional backgrounds / modes by playing.  Offer in-app purchase to skip score requirements for unlock.
