Rules
-----
Start with a number of pieces such that fewer than n of any one color are touching.
Give player additional pieces periodically.  Period should decrease as score increases.

Remove (n) or more overlapping pieces, add to score.  Should have multiplier for more than (n).

Particle Linking and Traversal
------------------------------
Each particle maintains a list of particles of the same color it is in contact with.
This works, but sometimes does not find largest chain because particles may be slightly separated.  How can I make sure there is a collision?
Each time a _pair_ is made, add one of the items to an array to be checked.
Each step, check the array for chains of length > 3.
Chain should be exist for N second before being scored.

TODO
----
. Adjust touch controls.
    Launch only from left.
    Increase level rotation rate.
    
. Automatic drop with timer.

. Game Start Condition
    Start board with a set of random particles.

. Game End Condition
    Piece limit (more than X and you lose).
    Distance limit. (Lose if resting particles are outside of sensors.)

. Finish Main menu with options and website links.

. Replace reset button with pause menu.

. Artwork.

. Sound effects.
    What should this sound like?

* Scoring
    Fix scoring bugs: Doesn't always match largest set.

New Name?
