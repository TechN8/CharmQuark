Rules
-----
Start with a number of pieces such that fewer than n of any one color are touching.
Give player additional pieces periodically.  Period should decrease as score increases.

Remove (n) or more overlapping pieces, add to score.  Should have multiplier for more than (n).

Particle Linking and Traversal
------------------------------
Each particle maintains a list of particles of the same color it is in contact with.
This works, but sometimes does not find largest chain because particles may be slightly separated.  How can I make sure there is a collision?
Each time a _pair_ is made, add one of the items to an array to be checked.
Each step, check the array for chains of length > 3.
Chain should be exist for N second before being scored.

TODO
----
. Game End Condition
    Distance limit. (Lose if resting particles are outside of sensors.)
    Piece limit (more than X and you lose).

. Game Start Condition
    Start board with a better set of random particles.
    Fix pop-in animation

. Automatic drop with timer?

. Show next 2 pieces?

. Finish Main menu with options and website links.

. Replace reset button with pause menu.

. Animations
    Exploding particle.
    Trail effect on dropped particle?
    Score and multiplier animations.
    Thumb guides.  (Do in draw override for GameplayLayer).
        . Aiming recticle.
        . Turn radius.

. Artwork.
    Prettier sprites.  
        Ideas: 
            . Vector-look with physics symbols.  Magnetic field lines on grid bacground.
            . Astronomical bodies (stars, comets, planets).  Starfield background.
            . Marbles.  Wooden bowl background.
            . Other?

. Special pieces.
    Match anything?
    High KE/mass particle. (Hard hit)
    Exploding particle.  (Shuffle)

. Sound effects.
    What should this sound like?  Depends on artwork.

New Name?
---------
