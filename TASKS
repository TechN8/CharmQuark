. Actually draw some tracks...
    For each track call {
        Create CCRenderTexture and add as child of detector.
        Draw lines in ccrender texture by moving and visiting small particle image.
        Calculate intersection points of beziers with detectors by tracking radius as particles are drawn.
    }
    New Plan
    For each track {
        Add coordinates and duration to array.
    }
    in visit for Detector {
        GLDraw the tracks at the appropriate brightness.
        Remove when time expires.
        Do as batch.
    }

. Itunes artwork.        

. Logo

. Splash screens & update icon?

. Do iPad version of detector with another ring...
    -Do this in 2 parts inner and outer.  Draw inners at 0,90,180,270; Outers at 45, 135, 225, 315.
    -Intersection with outers should be drawn as yellow dot with green lines.
    
. Credits screen.
    [Show blinking detector in background];
    [Do this on home screen too?]

. Music
    . Play a nice mp3 on the menus and game.
        - GameScene - Track from LHC
        - Menu - Something else?
    . Music on/off (Should behave as off if ipod is playing)

. Final Sound effects.
    Grab some samples from http://lhcsound.hep.ucl.ac.uk. 
        These are all CC and generated from LHC data!
        
. Main menu scene
    X Accellerator
    X Time Attack
    X Meditation
    X Options (Sound Volumes).
    . High scores
        - Separate scene / layer, or show next to mode selectors...
    . Website link (direct to FaceBook?)
    . Social media links.
    . Background graphics 
        - Make this screen look like a computer desktop.
        - 3 icons for game modes.
        - 

. Game Center Support for high score.    
    
. Help Overlay
    Should explain how to rotate and drop. 
    Show on game scene first time.
    Reset from options screen.

. Remove map, replace with "pac-man" clock?
    or
. Adjust map downwards and move log.
    or
. Leave it alone.

. Localization
    Google translate menus.  Game is pretty self explanitory.
    Will need to generate BMFonts with reduced subset of characters for Japanese / Chinese.
    
X Consistent simulation dimensions between iPhone and iPad
    Use 1024 x 768 sim dimensions.
    Scale to 480x320 = * 0.46875 for iPhone draws. (May need to adjust.)
    Scale factor should be iPhone puzzleCenter.x / iPad puzzleCenter.x.
