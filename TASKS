X Consistent simulation dimensions between iPhone and iPad
    Use 1024 x 768 sim dimensions.
    Scale to 480x320 = * 0.46875 for iPhone draws.

X Animated background.
    Monochrome trace of CERN installation.
    Use as drop timer for next particle launch.

        Ideas: 
            . Vector-look with physics symbols.  Magnetic field lines on grid bacground.
            . Astronomical bodies (stars, comets, planets).  Starfield background.

. Localization
    Google translate menus.  Game is pretty self explanitory.

. Blur background on overlay layers.
    UIImage *tempImage =[GameScene takeAsUIImage];
    CCTexture2DMutable *mutableTexture = [[[CCTexture2DMutable alloc] tempImage autorelease];
    [AWTextureFilter blur:mutableTexture radius:6];
    
Questionable Enhancements
-------------------------
    
. Automatic drop of extra random pieces?  No auto drop of user pieces?

. Show next 2 pieces?
