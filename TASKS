Future Enhancements
-------------------
. Game Center Achievements
. Twitter / Facebook
. Actually draw some tracks...
    - May be able to use CCDrawNode when it gets faster.
    - Or FRCurve if it gets added to cocos2d.
    - Or Bezier curve, but it's a pain to fade them.
    - Or some pre-rendered animation...
