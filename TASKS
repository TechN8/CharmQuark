. New BGM
    - Break into 4 measure sections.
    - Three versions, mellow, normal, intense.
    - Slow chords in mellow
    - Add lead for normal
    - Add percussion / fast beat for intense.
    - Set speed based on particles.count.
    - Add to Plist
    - Play from game manager
    - Use mellow for menu / credits.

. Collision & explosion sounds
    . Add more voices for collision, 5 notes x 2 octaves should be good.
    . Play with thresholds for collision volumes, I think these are a bit off from scaling changes.
    . Have separate voice / melody for scoring / bonus / combo.

. Final Sound effects.
    Use afconvert tool to convert.
        afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@22050 --mix -c 1  
    Check out some more sounds at www.freesound.org.
    . Click sound for menus and controls would be nice.

. Re-center map, move log to display over puzzle.
    - Log messages should pop up and then fade out.
    - Messages should be removed after fade.
    - Messages should appear over the puzzle.
    - Messages should be partly transparent.

Future Enhancements
-------------------
. Game Center Achievements
. Twitter / Facebook
. Actually draw some tracks...
    - May be able to use CCDrawNode when it gets faster.
    - Or FRCurve if it gets added to cocos2d.
    - Or Bezier curve, but it's a pain to fade them.
    - Or some pre-rendered animation...
    
. Enhanced HD graphics, possible on the detector / particles.
    -Do this in 2 parts inner and outer.  Draw inners at 0,90,180,270; Outers at 45, 135, 225, 315.
    -Intersection with outers should be drawn as yellow dot with green lines.

. Help Overlay
    Should explain how to rotate and drop. 
    Show on game scene first time.
    Reset from options screen.

. Localization
    Google translate menus.  Game is pretty self explanitory.
    Will need to generate BMFonts with reduced subset of characters for Japanese / Chinese.

. Left handed play
