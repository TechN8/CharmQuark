. Pause / resume.
    Try to re-create crash.  Make sure all memory / suspend code is handled correctly.

. Final fonts.
    Use on Dialogs as well as score.
    Left align.
    Show blinking cursor? 
    Pause =     [1]+    Stopped     simulation

. Credits screen.
    [Show blinking detector in background];
    [Do this on home screen too?]

        - GameScene - Track from LHC
        - Menu - Something else?

. Final Sound effects.
    Make sure collision sound doesn't play at level start.
    Use afconvert tool to convert.
    afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@22050 --mix -c 1  
    Grab some samples from lhcsound.hep.ucl.ac.uk. 
        These are all CC and generated from LHC data!
    Can also find sounds at www.freesound.org.
        
. Main menu scene
    X Accellerator
    X Time Attack
    X Meditation
    X Options (Sound Volumes).

. Game Center Support for high score.    
    
. Do iPad version of detector with another ring...
    -Do this in 2 parts inner and outer.  Draw inners at 0,90,180,270; Outers at 45, 135, 225, 315.
    -Intersection with outers should be drawn as yellow dot with green lines.
    
. Help Overlay
    Should explain how to rotate and drop. 
    Show on game scene first time.

. Remove map, replace with "pac-man" clock?
    or
. Adjust map downwards and move log.
    or
. Leave it alone.

. Localization
    Google translate menus.  Game is pretty self explanitory.
    Will need to generate BMFonts with reduced subset of characters for Japanese / Chinese.
    
X Consistent simulation dimensions between iPhone and iPad
    Use 1024 x 768 sim dimensions.
    Scale to 480x320 = * 0.46875 for iPhone draws. (May need to adjust.)
    Scale factor should be iPhone puzzleCenter.x / iPad puzzleCenter.x.

Future Enhancements
-------------------
. Game Center Achievements
. Twitter / Facebook
. Actually draw some tracks...
    - May be able to use CCDrawNode when it gets faster.
    - Or FRCurve if it gets added to cocos2d.
    - Or Bezier curve, but it's a pain to fade them.
    - Or some pre-rendered animation...
