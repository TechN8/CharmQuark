. Actually draw some tracks...
    - May be able to use CCDrawNode when it gets faster.
    - Or FRCurve if it gets added to cocos2d.
    - Or Bezier curve, but it's a pain to fade them.
    - Or some pre-rendered animation...
    
. Enhanced HD graphics, possible on the detector / particles.
    -Do this in 2 parts inner and outer.  Draw inners at 0,90,180,270; Outers at 45, 135, 225, 315.
    -Intersection with outers should be drawn as yellow dot with green lines.

. Localization
    Google translate menus.  Game is pretty self explanitory.
    Will need to generate BMFonts with reduced subset of characters for Japanese / Chinese.
